# Designing Splitwise

Design a system like Splitwise. Splitwise is a tool for friends and roommates to track bills and other shared expenses, 
so that everyone gets paid back. On Splitwise, people can enter their expenses, split them between the people in their group, 
and the app will tell them who owes money to whom.

_Note: The idea is to build a fully functional app, not only the design._

## Requirements
- [ ] The system should allow users to create accounts and manage their profile information.
- [ ] Users should be able to create groups and add other users to the groups.
- [ ] Users should be able to add expenses within a group, specifying the amount, description, and participants.
- [ ] The system should automatically split the expenses among the participants based on their share.
- [ ] Users should be able to view their individual balances with other users and settle up the balances.
- [ ] The system should support different split methods, such as equal split, percentage split, and exact amounts.
- [ ] Users should be able to view their transaction history and group expenses.
- [ ] The system should handle concurrent transactions and ensure data consistency.

## Optional
- [ ] Use some tool to provide the user with a frontend interface (No need for a fancy authentication)
